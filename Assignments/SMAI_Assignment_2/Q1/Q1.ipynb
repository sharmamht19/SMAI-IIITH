Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255. The training and test data sets have 785 columns. The first column consists of the class labels (see above), and represents the article of clothing. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.

In an original image each pixel has 3 8-bit integers, therefore the size of the image is **3 x height x width x 8**. Our task is to compress the image where it only comprises of **k** unique colors, where k = number of clusters formed by the algorithm where each pixel is a 3D datapoint. Therefore the new compressed image can be stored in **k x 24 + width x height x b**. (b -> number of bits used to represent the integer *k*, since each pixel will have a color value from 0 to k-1). Now your task is to experiment with different values of k (atleast 3) and show the compressed image along with the value of data reduction (in terms of bits). \n","\n","(an example image has been provided in the folder)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-xOn_5pnk1uI"},"source":["## Part1: K Means"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yY8uMDe9quTE"},"outputs":[],"source":["#implement elbow method from scratch\n","def elbow():\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"32x9M36qq2fO"},"outputs":[],"source":["#implement silhouette method from scratch\n","def silhouette():\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":38,"metadata":{"id":"6j7nYmipmrC6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1676872373765,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1082,"user":{"displayName":"mehul mathur","userId":"15314305561639602729"}},"outputId":"6f61d020-9966-44c3-c8d3-eda665024b58"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["10K images flattened:  (10000, 784)  and 10k labels:  (10000,)\n"]}],"source":["# LOADING THE DATASET.
